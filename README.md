## About Me

I am an **Electrical & Electronics Engineering** undergraduate at **Strathmore University** with a deep specialization in **Software Architecture** and **Developer Tooling**. 

I bridge the gap between low-level engineering logic and high-level software solutions. My passion lies in building **robust, type-safe, and self-healing systems**. I don't just write code; I engineer scalable infrastructure.

- **Currently working on:** [Lazy Appwrite](https://github.com/Ghunter254/lazy-appwrite) (A declarative ORM for Appwrite).
- **Currently learning:** Advanced Distributed Systems & Kubernetes.
- **Based in:** Nairobi, Kenya.

## Featured Project

### [Lazy Appwrite](https://github.com/Ghunter254/lazy-appwrite)
> *Stop clicking. Start coding.*

A declarative, self-healing SDK for Node.js that treats your Database Infrastructure as Code.
- **Problem:** Managing Appwrite schemas manually via the console is error-prone and hard to scale.
- **Solution:** Defines schemas in TypeScript. The library creates Databases, Collections, and Indexes on runtime.
- **Key Tech:** Mutex locking for race-condition safety, Schema Drift detection, and Smart Type Coercion.
